# SQL Injection Learning Script

This repository contains a Python script that I created while learning SQL injection techniques. In other words, I am documenting every SQL injection I attempt through scripting. 

I am learning SQL injection using the Burp Suite Web Academy.

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python3 script.py <url> <payload>
